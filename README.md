# Disease Predictor Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project is a disease prediction system that uses machine learning algorithms to diagnose diseases based on user-reported symptoms. The system integrates three types of classifiers—Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes—into a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) to provide predictions.

## Features

- **Disease Prediction:** Predicts potential diseases based on user input symptoms.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Utilizes Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes classifiers.
- **User Interface:** Interactive GUI built with Tkinter for ease of use.
- **Data Handling:** Handles medical datasets to train and test the prediction models.
